Hi there! My name is John and I'm a web developer based in San Francisco. I specialize in building custom websites and web applications that are not only functional, but also visually stunning.

I have a degree in Computer Science from Stanford University and have been working in the tech industry for over 5 years. During that time, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects, from simple landing pages to complex e-commerce platforms.

What sets me apart from other developers is my passion for design. I believe that a great website should not only work well, but also look amazing. That's why I always strive to create websites that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

My key strengths include proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, as well as a keen eye for detail and a love of problem-solving. I'm also highly collaborative and love working with clients to bring their vision to life.

In my free time, you can find me hiking in the mountains, practicing yoga, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

I'm always looking for new opportunities to take on exciting projects and work with interesting people. Let's connect and see how we can work together!
